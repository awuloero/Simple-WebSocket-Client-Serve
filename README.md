# Simple-WebSocket-Client-Serve
This repository features a simple WebSocket client-server application using Python's `asyncio` and `websockets` libraries. The server listens on `localhost:5000`, receiving and responding to client messages. The client connects, sends user-input messages, and displays server responses. Ideal for understanding basic WebSocket communication in Python
